Welcome to the ipfs-browser! This simple web page allows users to interact with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) by providing an IPFS hash value. The web page fetches the content associated with the provided hash from the IPFS network and displays it to the user.

## What is IPFS?

IPFS, which stands for InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer protocol and network designed to create a more permanent and decentralized method of storing and sharing hypermedia. Unlike traditional centralized web servers, IPFS distributes content across a network of peers, making it more resilient to censorship and failure.

### Key Features of IPFS:

- **Decentralization:** IPFS operates on a distributed network of nodes, where each node stores a portion of the content. This makes the system more fault-tolerant and resistant to central points of failure.

- **Content Addressing:** Instead of relying on location-based URLs, IPFS uses content-based addressing. This means that content is identified by its cryptographic hash, which ensures that the same content will always have the same address.

- **Caching:** Since content is addressed by its hash, repeated requests for the same content can be cached locally, reducing redundant data transfer.

- **Versioning:** Every change to a file creates a new cryptographic hash, allowing for easy versioning of content.

## How to Use This Web Page:

1. **Input IPFS Hash:** Enter the IPFS hash value of the content you want to retrieve in the provided input field.

2. **Retrieve Content:** Click the "Retrieve" button to fetch the content associated with the provided hash from the IPFS network.

3. **View Content:** Once retrieved, the content (such as text, images, or videos) will be displayed on the web page for you to view.
